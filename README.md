# Sprint 3 IT Academy | Video management tool

## Introduction

A company in the audiovisual sector has asked us for a web application that will allow their employees to quickly find movies from a large database they have, since the process is currently done manually.

You will be in charge of setting up the core of the application: all the logic of filtering and sorting of movies. You have 2 weeks to finish, which is how long this sprint lasts.

## Tests!

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run test:watch
```

And last, open the generated `test-results.html` file with the "Live Server" VSCode extension to see test results.

Apart from the statement, you will know exactly what you are asked to do by looking at the file `tests/films.spec.js`, all tests are already defined here!
